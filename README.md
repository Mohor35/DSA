Hospital Management System Using Linked Lists and Priority Queues

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of a Hospital Management System (HMS) developed as part of the B.Tech curriculum at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bengaluru.

The HMS aims to enhance operational efficiency and quality of care in healthcare facilities. It manages essential administrative functions such as patient registration, doctor management, billing, pharmacy inventory, and patient checkups. The system utilizes linked lists and priority queues to ensure efficient management of records and prioritization of emergency cases.



Project Abstract

The Hospital Management System is designed to improve operational effectiveness and quality of care within healthcare facilities. It incorporates functionalities for patient administration, scheduling, billing, inventory management, electronic health record handling, and reporting. The system employs linked lists for managing dynamic data such as patient and doctor records, and priority queues for handling patient prioritization based on urgency. The goal is to support streamlined operations, minimize manual errors, and provide an integrated platform for hospital administration.

- Secure login functionality to restrict system access
- Patient management using linked lists for efficient data handling
- Doctor record management including scheduling and availability tracking
- Priority queue implementation to manage emergency patient cases
- Medicine inventory management with add, update, and search functionalities
- Patient checkup records management with retrieval and update capabilities
- User-friendly graphical user interface across modules

System Requirements

Software Requirements

- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Programming Language: Java, Python, C#, or JavaScript
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio, or similar
- User Interface Libraries:
  - For Java: Swing or JavaFX
  - For Web-based development: React or Angular

Hardware Requirements

- Multi-core processor for handling concurrent operations
- Minimum 8 GB RAM for optimal performance
- Sufficient SSD storage for database files and application data

Results and Analysis

The HMS effectively integrates multiple modules to optimize hospital operations. Linked lists are utilized for managing dynamic patient and doctor records, enabling efficient insertions and deletions. Priority queues facilitate the handling of emergency cases, ensuring that patients with critical needs receive timely attention. The system minimizes manual errors, enhances data accessibility, and provides a user-friendly interface, contributing to improved administrative efficiency and patient care.

Future Enhancements
